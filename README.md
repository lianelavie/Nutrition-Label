# Nutrition-Label
The task is to simply create a nutrition label 
This is an HTML and CSS code for a nutrition label. It includes a header with the title, serving size, and number of servings per container, a section for calorie information, a section for daily value information, and a note explaining the daily value percentages.

# Usage
To use this code, simply copy and paste the HTML and CSS code into separate files with the extensions .html and .css, respectively. Then, open the HTML file in a web browser to view the nutrition label.

# Modifying the Code
To modify the code, you can edit the HTML and CSS files to change the content and styling of the nutrition label. The code uses various classes to style the elements, such as .bold, .small-text, .divider, and .indent. You can modify these classes to change the font styles, margins, and padding of the elements.

# Dependencies
This code uses the Open Sans font family from Google Fonts, which is linked in the <head> section of the HTML code. To use the code offline or on a different server, you may need to download and host the font files yourself.
